# Summary

Transport Microservices is an app for an imagined logistics company. The aim of building this was to try new ways or architecting a microservices application, where each microservice could be deployed to Azure Container Apps independently.

## Future plans

The majority of the vertical stack that I wanted to build is largely there, however I want to expand this horizontally, as only a very small slice has so far been developed. I also want to start adding unit and automation tests, as so far I'd decided not to focus on them.
