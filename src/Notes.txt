big problem with old system was being able to show a list of the jobs.

The job list will include data from multiple microservices.

So should we maintain a searchable list of jobs with aggregated/merged data?

perhaps in Solr/elasticsearch

whenever a JobUpdatedIntegrationEvent/created/deleted is received, completely refresh the record for that job.
